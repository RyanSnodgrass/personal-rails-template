1. #1 priority is stability. The first time it doesn’t run correctly we lose developer trust that this app is still relevant
2. #2 priority is maintainability. Ties together with priority 1. Have to be able to easily edit this and update it to the latest version easily. else it’ll fall behind and no one will want to maintain it
3. #3 Transparency. I don’t trust app engines. I always think they add BS I don’t need. I want this thing to spit out what it does different to a default rails app. when running the command it should list all the changes it made
